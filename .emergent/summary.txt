The previous AI engineer successfully initiated the AI Brand Visibility Scanner (futureseo), evolving it from MVP to an enterprise-grade SaaS. The development trajectory highlights an iterative approach, with significant efforts focused on addressing critical user feedback regarding fake data and non-functional features. Key challenges included persistent frontend syntax errors, but most critically, the underlying issue of mock data being displayed instead of real AI-generated insights. The OpenAI API integration proved particularly problematic, repeatedly failing due to environmental proxy issues, leading to generic responses and inaccurate metrics. Despite multiple attempts to fix the OpenAI integration and associated data display, the problem resurfaced, directly impacting core functionalities like source domain/article extraction, visibility calculations, and scan progress tracking. The engineer also focused on UI improvements (header, scan buttons, brand dropdown) and added core features like brand editing and a historical growth chart. The recurring theme is the battle to transition from mocked to genuinely extracted and processed data from the LLMs.

The goal is to develop futureseo, an SEMrush/Ahrefs for ChatGPT tool, to track brand visibility across AI platforms (ChatGPT, Gemini, Google AI Overview). It requires enterprise-grade SaaS features: user authentication, multi-brand management with brand-specific data, enhanced competitor analysis, advanced query tracking, AI-generated content recommendations, and API usage tracking linked to tiered pricing (Free Trial, Basic, Pro, Enterprise). Critical requirements include accurate, real-time, brand-specific data (not mock data), mobile responsiveness, a functional brand selector, week-over-week growth tracking, and detailed source domain/article attribution. The application must provide actionable insights like content gap analysis and backlink opportunities. Recent demands emphasize simplifying scan types, showing real progress bars, making competitor analysis and query details dynamic with actual GPT quotes and full responses, providing specific GPT-triggered content briefs, honest competitive intelligence, and limiting scans to once per brand per week.

<code_architecture>
The application uses a full-stack architecture comprising a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB database.

**Directory Structure:**


**Key Files and Their Importance/Changes:**

-   
    -   **Summary**: The central FastAPI application. Manages API routes, database interactions, JWT authentication, and all OpenAI API integrations.
    -   **Changes**: Extensive modifications for JWT authentication, multi-brand support, and real OpenAI (GPT-4o-mini) integration. Updated to filter data by  across dashboard, competitors, queries, and recommendations. Critical changes include refined  and  to produce realistic queries and extract detailed data (ranking, sentiment, features, content gaps, backlinks). Scan deduction logic was fixed. New endpoints , ,  were added, with focus on real data extraction. Logic for  to  conversion for MongoDB documents was crucial. Most recently updated to handle OpenAI API proxy issues, implement real-time scan progress tracking, historical data fetching, and return full brand objects on creation. It also now contains new functions for enhanced competitor analysis, query analysis, and content brief generation.
-   
    -   **Summary**: The primary React component managing UI rendering, routing, navigation, dashboard sections, and user interactions.
    -   **Changes**: Multiple refactorings to implement the Am I On AI UI across all 7 tabs. Implemented functional brand selector, mobile responsiveness. Logic added for real-time scan usage display. Updated Recommendations section. New Source Domains and Source Articles sections were added, with ongoing fixes for real data display and pagination. Key recent changes include fixing scan button logic and loading states, implementing a professional blocking scan modal with real progress, fixing brand disappearance after Maybe Later and improving the brand dropdown. Also updated to use real historical data for growth charts and incorporate brand editing UI. Header layout has been fixed for better responsiveness. Removed All Brands option and simplified scan type selection to one button.
-   
    -   **Summary**: React component for pricing tiers.
    -   **Changes**: Displays Free Trial, Basic, Pro, and Enterprise plans with features and scan limits.
-   
    -   **Summary**: New file created to house functions responsible for parsing and extracting real source domain and article data from ChatGPT responses.
    -   **Changes**: Moved extraction logic from  to this dedicated file, ensuring it handles real data and is more robust. Updated to be more flexible in parsing responses and includes fallback logic.
-   
    -   **Summary**: New file containing mock data for scan results, used as a fallback or during development.
    -   **Changes**: Created to centralize mock data, to be used when real OpenAI API calls fail or are not available.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   **Paddle Integration**: Full implementation for subscription billing.
-   **Gemini API Integration**: Actual API integration for Gemini scans (Gemini 1.5 Flash recommended).
-   **Google AI Overview Integration**: Backend logic for fetching/parsing data (likely via SerpAPI).
-   **Content Analysis/Blog Scanning**: Advanced feature for Enterprise plans.
-   **Slack/Discord Alerts**: Integration for notifications.
-   **Forget Password Implementation**: Frontend and backend logic for password reset.
-   **Enhanced GPT-Driven Insights**: Frontend implementation for new competitor analysis, query details, content briefs, and competitive intelligence as outlined by the user.
-   **Weekly Scan Limit**: Implement logic to limit scans to once per brand per week.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was critically addressing several issues raised by the user:
1.  **Brand Disappearance**: The user reported that new brands disappeared from the UI after clicking Maybe Later on the scan popup, and the brand dropdown became broken. The engineer implemented a fix by ensuring  is called when Maybe Later is clicked and that brands are properly initialized on app load in .
2.  **Stuck Scan Progress Bar**: The user observed that the scan progress bar was stuck for over 2 minutes without feedback. The engineer acknowledged this as a critical bug, investigating both backend progress tracking and OpenAI API issues.
    *   **Backend Progress Tracking**: A new scan progress tracking system was implemented in  to store real-time progress updates in MongoDB. This includes actual GPT queries being tracked.
    *   **Frontend Progress Display**:  was updated to poll the backend every 2 seconds for real progress, displaying the current query being processed, time estimates, and handling completion/failure states in a professional blocking modal.
    *   **OpenAI API Stability**: The engineer confirmed that the backend progress endpoint was fixed but noted that an issue with OpenAI integration in the *testing environment* might still be present, contributing to the stuck progress bar.
The current work is focused on ensuring the scan progress bar accurately reflects real backend activity, which hinges on a stable OpenAI API connection in the given environment.

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to thoroughly debug and stabilize the OpenAI API integration within the testing environment to ensure the scan progress bar functions reliably and then proceed with implementing the enhanced GPT-driven insights for competitor analysis, query details, and content briefs as per the user's explicit request.
Yes please - User in Chat Message 428, confirming the plan to implement enhanced GPT-driven insights.
However, there might still be an issue with the OpenAI integration in the testing environment. Let me check if the progress updates are actually happening and fix any remaining issues: - AI Engineer in Chat Message 442, indicating the immediate priority.
