The previous AI engineer successfully launched the AI Brand Visibility Scanner MVP, then iteratively expanded it into an enterprise-grade SaaS based on extensive user feedback. The trajectory reveals a pattern of continuous enhancement driven by user-identified gaps between claimed and actual functionality. Key work included implementing JWT authentication, multi-brand support, user-controlled scanning, and a comprehensive dashboard. Significant challenges arose from frontend syntax errors in , which required repeated bulk rewrites and troubleshooting. A recurring issue was the fake data problem, where the system presented mock or unrealistic metrics despite claims of 100% real data, leading to user dissatisfaction. The engineer also refined ChatGPT integration from basic mentions to sophisticated content gap and backlink analysis, but the real data extraction and display for new features like Source Domains and Source Articles became the immediate focus due to user's direct observation of mock data. The current phase is dedicated to rectifying this core issue, ensuring all displayed data is genuinely derived from AI scans with proper filtering and pagination.

The overarching goal is to develop an SEMrush/Ahrefs for ChatGPT tool, named futureseo, that tracks brand visibility across AI platforms like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Google AI Overview. It aims to provide enterprise-grade SaaS features including user authentication, multi-brand management with brand-specific data filtering, enhanced competitor analysis, advanced query tracking, AI-generated content recommendations, and API usage tracking tied to tiered pricing. Pricing tiers are Free Trial, Basic (9/month, 50 scans, 1 brand, ChatGPT only), Pro (9/month, 300 scans, 3 brands, ChatGPT + Gemini + AI Overview), and Enterprise (49/month, 1500 scans, 10 brands, all platforms + advanced features). Scan terminology replaced query for clarity. Critical user requirements evolved to include accurate, real-time data (not mock data), mobile responsiveness, a functional brand selector, week-over-week growth tracking, and detailed source domain/article attribution. The application must provide actionable insights, such as content gap analysis and backlink opportunities, while maintaining cost-efficiency through optimized LLM usage.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Backend**: FastAPI (Python), MongoDB (data storage).
-   **Frontend**: React.js, Tailwind CSS (UI).
-   **Authentication**: JWT-based user authentication.
-   **AI Integration**: OpenAI API (GPT-4o-mini). Gemini 1.5 Flash and SerpAPI for AI Overview are planned.
-   **Payments**: Paddle (framework, full setup pending).
-   **Deployment**: Railway (hosting), MongoDB Atlas (managed database), Cloudflare (CDN/DNS).
-   **Version Control**: GitHub.
-   **Data IDs**: UUIDs are used for MongoDB documents instead of ObjectIDs.

<code_architecture>
The application employs a standard full-stack architecture with a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB database.

**Directory Structure:**


**Key Files and Their Importance/Changes:**

-   
    -   **Summary**: The core FastAPI application for API routes, database, authentication, and OpenAI integrations.
    -   **Changes**: Heavily modified to support JWT authentication, multi-brand management, and real OpenAI API (GPT-4o-mini) integration. Updated significantly to accept  for filtering dashboard, competitor, query, and recommendation data. Enhanced  and  functions to produce realistic queries, extract detailed data (ranking, sentiment, features), and include content gap/backlink opportunities. Scan deduction logic was fixed. New endpoints for , , and  were added, the latter two are currently being implemented to ensure real data extraction.
-   
    -   **Summary**: The primary React component rendering the UI, including routing, navigation, dashboard sections, and user interactions.
    -   **Changes**: Underwent extensive refactoring and multiple rewrites (using  and  due to persistent syntax errors) to implement the Am I On AI professional UI. It now includes all 7 dashboard tabs (Overview, Competitors, Queries, Recommendations, Brands, Plans, Settings), a functional brand selector dropdown that filters all data, and full mobile/tablet/desktop responsiveness. Logic was added to refresh user data (scan usage) in real-time. The Recommendations section was updated to display content opportunities. Multiple attempts were made to integrate futureseo logos, which led to syntax errors, and the user requested a revert to text-based branding. New components/sections for Source Domains and Source Articles have been added to the UI, but their data display is currently being fixed to be real, not mock.
-   
    -   **Summary**: A React component for displaying pricing tiers.
    -   **Changes**: Created to modularize pricing plan display, showing Free Trial, Basic, Pro, and Enterprise plans with features and scan limits.
-   
    -   **Summary**: A script for manually upgrading user accounts.
    -   **Changes**: Created and executed once to grant Enterprise plan access for testing.
-    and 
    -   **Summary**: Store environment variables (MongoDB URL, API keys, JWT secret, backend URL).
    -   **Changes**: , , , SMTP details set in .  in .  and  were updated to reflect futureseo branding.
-   
    -   **Summary**: Project documentation.
    -   **Changes**: Updated multiple times to reflect futureseo branding, domain, features, tech stack, and installation steps, including detailed plan descriptions.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Paddle Integration**: The full implementation for subscription billing is pending.
-   **Gemini API Integration**: Actual API integration for Gemini scans needs to be developed, with Gemini 1.5 Flash being the recommended model.
-   **Google AI Overview Integration**: Backend logic for fetching and parsing Google AI Overview data, likely via SerpAPI, needs to be developed.
-   **Content Analysis/Blog Scanning**: Advanced feature for Enterprise plans is planned but not implemented.
-   **Slack/Discord Alerts**: Integration for notifications remains a future task.
-   **Realistic Source Domains/Articles Data**: Currently, these sections display mock data and require implementation of real data extraction, storage, and retrieval with pagination.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was tasked with a critical fix: addressing the user's concern that newly implemented Source Domains and Source Articles sections were displaying mock data instead of real, extracted insights. The user also highlighted the absence of pagination, non-functional buttons (categories, export), a cluttered header, and consistently similar query responses.

The AI engineer acknowledged these issues, explicitly stating the need to implement REAL functionality. The work commenced by focusing on the backend:
1.  **Enhancing ChatGPT Scan Function**: The  file is being modified to ensure that during a scan, the ChatGPT API not only generates recommendations but also extracts real Source Domain and Source Article data. This involves refining the prompts and parsing the responses more effectively to identify the most influential websites and specific URLs driving brand visibility in AI responses.
2.  **Storing Source Data**: The extracted real source data is then being stored persistently in the MongoDB database, moving away from any mock data previously used.
3.  **Pagination Implementation**: Although not explicitly detailed in the last few messages' code snippets, the AI engineer has committed to including proper pagination for the Source Domains and Articles, which implies both backend endpoint modifications to handle skip/limit parameters and frontend UI adjustments to display pagination controls.

The last message states, Let me finish implementing the real source domains and articles functionality with proper pagination, indicating that this is the immediate and ongoing task. This work directly addresses the fake data problem that has been a recurring point of user dissatisfaction throughout the trajectory.
